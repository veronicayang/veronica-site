	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>My first camera was a chunky silver digital Kodak. I was ten years old at the time so even though the quality was equivalent to that of a disposable camera, I was enthralled by it. </p>

	<p>Initially, suburban dogs, autumn leaves, antique diners, intriguing strangers, even my stuffed animal panda captured my attention but more recently, Tibetan monks, Southeast Asian landscapes, and New York urban life have inspired my galleries. </p>
	
	<p>My dream job is to work for National Geographic as a traveling photojournalist but that fantasy is literally and figuratively miles and miles away. In the meantime, I will continue taking photos of my Maltipoo puppy and my brunch meals, privately hoping to be scouted. </p>
